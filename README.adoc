== Infra Scheduler Operator

The purpose of this operator is to segregate OpenShift infrastructure workloads from normal tenant workloads.

The intention is to automate the structures around KCS https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5034771[Infrastructure Nodes in OpenShift 4]

createInfraPool
validateInfraPool
deleteInfraPool

Managed by MachineSets?
 -> Yes, createInfraMachineSets with infra label
   Pick default AZ MachineSet definitions to copy: which AZs? (default all AZs with replica of one or more, up to three nodes)
   How many of each AZ ?
   Compute Profile ?
   Apply by T&T ?
     -> add Taints to MachineSets
   Scale up N replicas of N MachineSets in each AZ
   remove worker label on each node 
   validate end state - reconcile on this.
 -> No, user pick nodes, 
    assignNodeLabel infra, 
    removeNodeLabel worker, 
    Apply by T&T?
      -> setNodeTaint
 
Managed by defaultnodeselector?
  -> setDefaultNodeSelectorOnScheduler

for each infra workload:
 -> setWorkloadNodeSelector
 Apply by T&T ? 
 -> setWorkloadToleration


Managed: true/false
Method: taints,defaultnodeselector
MachineSetDefs:
  AvailabilityZones: by cloud provider; list
  Replicas:
Nodes: list of nodes
(either Nodes or MachineSetDefs to be defined)
Isolate: true/false, determine whether to remove worker label

workloads:
- IngressController
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Registry
- ServiceMesh components
- Operators

also create a controller to modify inflight pod specs of any known infra workloads to apply at this particular point (prevents need for changing by using CRDs for each operator CRD)
